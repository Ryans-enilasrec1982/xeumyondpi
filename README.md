Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this   called Dual, and I swear my brain's doing somersaults right now. Like, first of all, who dreams up this stuff? It's like Black Mirror and an existential crisis had a weird little baby. The storyline was kind of like a soft migraine but in a good way—does that make sense? Probably not. It’s late… I'm tired.

Okay but can we talk about Karen Gillan? She plays, like, two roles and it's both amazing and sort of unsettling—like that time I saw a dog walking backward. I mean, one Karen is already enough to make you feel a little inadequate, right? Here, you've got two. TWO. Better start rethinking my life choices.

> So, the eternal question: if there's another version of you, does that mean you can play hooky all day while your clone works the grind? There's definitely part of me intrigued by that thought. It’s like having your cake and...𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the clone eat it too? Not sure if that's comforting or nightmare fuel.

And, excuse me, why am I low-key invested in a storyline where people fight to the death just to own their own lives again? Is this a metaphor for adulting? Honestly, I’d rather just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again instead of sorting out my mortgage. Thanks for the life lesson, Sam.

Some scenes felt like coffee-stained dreams. It’s a cool idea, right—kinda like when you're convinced you've got extra fries at the bottom of the bag, only to realize you don't. You think, “Ugh, why is this? Who decided this?” but in the end, you're just glad you took the damn bag home.

```
int cloneFight = 1;
while(cloneFight == 1) {
  Console.WriteLine(Who am I really?);
  cloneFight--;
}
```

Maybe that's the point? I dunno. What's life if not a constant dual between what you want and the person scarfing chips on your sofa? I’m probably going to mull this over in bed tonight, if I even sleep. Anyway, you should really 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you can. Or don't. Your clone might have better things to do.
